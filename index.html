            <h1>The Soviet impact on Baltic states</h1>
          
        </div>
        <div class="main">
          <p class= id="content"> In 1990 the Soviet Union (USSR) dissolution after growing tension within the
            state. The Soviet Union had previously occupied the Baltic nations (Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania), before the
            second world war(1939,1940), and continuing after german troops retreated (1944-1991). Following
            independence, the transition into a market economy, the Baltic states along with Russia went into a state of
            recession. Child mortality increased after following a steady decrease since 1975.
          </p>
          <div class="vis1" id="vis1"></div>
          <p>The transition to the market economy was a difficult transition for the Baltic states at first, "economic
            stagnation due to the failure of the communist economic model (and subsequent severe economic decline in the
            1990s exacerbated by forced restructuring of the economy)."(Mackenbach, Karanikolos & McKee, 2013). A marked
            plateau is clearly visible displayed in the graph above from 1990-1995. Latvia's mortality trend stopped its
            decline whereas, Lithuania had a marked increase converging with Estonia and following a similar trend to
            that of Russia. This trend was short-lived with a sharp Pitch change and decrease in child mortality after
            1995 and "After large GDP declines in the early 1990s, the second half of the decade saw rapid economic
            growth, only interrupted by the fallouts from the Russian crisis in 1999."(Staehr, 2015). The Russian crisis
            was also the same time child mortality started to plateau in baltic countries but decreasing more rapidly in
            Russia.</p> 
          <p>During this period there was still marked tension between the Baltic States and Russia. In September 1998
            the Baltic states were finally free of external controlling entities and independent.
          </p>
          <div class="vis2" id="vis2"></div>
          <p>Child mortality rates in Baltic nations are disproportionately higher than in neighbouring nations
            such as Finland. Largely because "At the end of the 1980s, life expectancies started to fall as the
            Gorbachev anti-alcohol campaign was abandoned, and in the early 1990s this deterioration accelerated because
            of the severe socioeconomic crisis that followed the brutal transition to a market economy"(Jasilionis,
            Meslé, Shkolnikov & Vallin, 2011, p.404). Remarkably after transitioning to market economy's, the Baltic
            states were able to begin to prosper as they were no longer controlled by the motherland, Russia.</p>
          
          <br>
          <div class="vis4" id="vis4"></div>
          <p>Towards the end of 2010 morality was dropping around the world with advancements in technology and healthcare have enabled. the above chart contains a second line for each country providing further insight into the future of morality within the area. In 2017 when our data set ends the difference between Russia and the Baltics is 3.73% and if Russia continues its trend downwards compared to Latvia and Lithuania flattering curve, we could see Russia finally overtake one or more of the Baltic nations but 2025.</p><br>
          <div class="vis3" id="vis3"></div>
          <p>Life expectancy and child mortality have an inverse relationship with each other in the '90s and early
            2000s. Life expectancy started to drop in post-Soviet nations after the dissolution of the USSR, at the same
            time that child mortality rates were increasing. Interestingly in 1995, when life expectancy started to rise
            again for baltic nations, it continued declining within Russia. in 1995 the gap between the baltic states
            and Russia's child mortality was 6.1% and in 2000 it had risen to 9.12%. Life expectancy in 2001 within
            Russia reached its lowest point of 64.9 years, Baltic nations being 70.7 years averaged. By 2005 the gap in
            child mortality started to converge dropping down to 6.42% closer to the difference between the 4 nations in
            1995. </p> 
          <p>This trend was also followed by life expectancy which started trending upwards in all nations. In the early
            2000s all 3 nations implemented a new healthcare system, "Estonia seems to have been the most successful and
            Lithuania the least, with Latvia’s performance falling in the middle....The contrasting changes in life
            expectancy at birth in the three Baltic countries over 2000–2007 are mainly explained by differences in the
            dynamics of cardiovascular diseases, external causes of death and digestive diseases."(Jasilionis, Meslé,
            Shkolnikov & Vallin, 2011)</p>
            <p>Thankfully child mortality rates are nowhere near what they used to be but. Comparatively, you can see the obvious effect being under the influence and control of other countries for so long has had detrimental impacts, any area that was once controlled by the Soviet Union is damaged and it is clear the level of impact these events are having as the gap between them and other nations takes a long time to close.</p>
