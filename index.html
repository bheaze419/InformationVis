      <p class="header" id="content"> The Soviet union occupied the Baltic nations (Estonia, Latvia, lithuania) both
        before the second world war(1939,1940), and continuing after german troops retreated (1944-1991). The impact on
        the wellbeing of these nations is quite significant. Ever since 1991 when the Soviet union ceased occupation,
        child mortality has dropped significantly. However, disproportionately compared to surrounding nations such as
        Finland. Largely because "At the end of the 1980s, life expectancies started to fall as the Gorbachev
        anti-alcohol campaign was abandoned, and in the early 1990s this deterioration accelerated because of the severe
        socioeconomic crisis that followed the brutal transition to a market economy"(Jasilionis, Mesl√©, Shkolnikov &
        Vallin, 2011, p.404), remarkably after transitioning to market economy's, the Baltic states were able to begin
        to prosper as they were no longer controlled by the mother land.
